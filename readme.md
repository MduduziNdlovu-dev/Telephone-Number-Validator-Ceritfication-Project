# South African Phone Number Validator

This project is a South African phone number validator web app. It validates if the entered phone number is a valid South African number based on the country's area codes and the number of digits. The app also includes language localization support and allows users to toggle between light and dark modes.

## Features

- **Phone Number Validation**: Validates South African mobile numbers starting with `+27` or `0` and ensures the phone number follows the proper format with 9 digits after the area code.
- **Language Support**: Supports both English and Afrikaans, with the ability to switch languages through a dropdown.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between dark and light modes for a more comfortable user experience.
- **History**: The app saves validation history locally, allowing users to view previously validated phone numbers.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring it works on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
